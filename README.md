# illuminati

create secure peer to peer networks using secret-handshakes.

Illuminati builds on [secret-handshake](https://github.com/dominictarr/secret-handshake)
and [muxrpc](https://github.com/ssbc/muxrpc) to provide a framework
that makes it easier to build things like [scuttlebot](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot)
(which it was refactored out of ;)
